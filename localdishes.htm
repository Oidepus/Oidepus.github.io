    <h1><strong>FOODS</strong></h1>
    <p>Planning a romantic break to France's capital city? Between casual strolls along the Seine and stops to enjoy the many cultural offerings, make sure you indulge in some of the city's most delicious cuisine...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4><i>Baguette</i></h4>
        <img src="./img/localdishes/localdishes_1.jpg" style="width:400px;height:250px" alt="baguette">
        <p>It is safe to say that Paris is the place on Earth with the highest density of top-quality, artisanal baguettes. Each year a competition is held to elect the 'Meilleure Baguette de Paris', and the list of best-baguette awardees is a good resource
          to select your provider. Don’t forget to tear off the crusty, still-warm tip and nibble on it as you walk away, as any self-respecting Parisian does.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4><i>Steak-Frites</i></h4>
        <img src="./img/localdishes/localdishes_2.jpg" style="width:400px;height:250px" alt="frite">
        <p>The epitome of the bistro dish, this simple pairing of a grilled steak with various optional sauces and chips is elevated to serious heights when the meat is well selected and carefully matured, and the potatoes are fresh, hand-cut and double-fried.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4><i>Croque-monsieur</i></h4>
        <img src="./img/localdishes/localdishes_3.jpg" style="width:400px;height:250px" alt="croque">
        <p>Most brasseries and cafés in Paris offer non-stop service, and a staple of their menu is the croque-monsieur, an oozy and crisp grilled ham and cheese sandwich usually moistened by a touch of Béchamel sauce. If you’re extra hungry, get the croque-madame,
          which adds a fried egg on top.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4><i>Duck Confit</i></h4>
        <img src="./img/localdishes/localdishes_4.jpg" style="width:400px;height:250px" alt="Duck Confit">
        <p>Originally devised to preserve fresh duck meat for future consumption, the confit method consists of cooking duck thighs in their own fat, until the meat is spectacularly moist and fork-tender. Few Parisian bistros make their own, but they pride
          themselves in selecting the best producer, typically from the Southwest of France, and serve them seared until the skin turns golden and crisp. The classic side is pommes sarladaises, heavenly garlicky potatoes sautéed in duck fat. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4><i>Jambon-Beurre</i></h4>
        <img src="./img/localdishes/localdishes_5.png" style="width:400px;height:300px" alt="Jambon">
        <p>Like all city dwellers, Parisians often need to eat on the go, and the jambon-beurre is the most Parisian of sandwiches. You can buy it from corner bakeries or order it from the counter at most cafés; in both cases it will come as a fresh half-baguette,
          its insides smeared with cool butter and garnished with 'jambon de Paris', a pink-hued cooked ham, with optional cornichons.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Croissant</h4>
        <img src="./img/localdishes/localdishes_6.jpg" style="width:400px;height:250px" alt="Croissant">
        <p>Walk past any bakery in the wee hours of the morning and you’ll be instantly spellbound by the warm buttery smell of fresh croissants escaping from the air vents at pavement level. This is your cue to step in and get your golden prize, which you
          can tuck into and savour on your morning walk as the city awakens. Sadly, fewer and fewer French bakeries make their croissants from scratch – they buy them frozen instead – so it’s worth asking to make sure your boulanger still engages in that
          noble, delicious craft.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Macaron</h4>
        <img src="./img/localdishes/localdishes_7.jpg" style="width:400px;height:300px" alt="Macaron">
        <p>The delicate pastry, consisting of two almond meringue shells glued together with buttercream or ganache, has taken the world by storm but its birthplace is resolutely Paris. Available in all sorts of flavours and just as many colours, macarons
          are two-bite delights, but it is worth seeking them out from reputable pastry shops that actually make their own – many just hop on the bandwagon and sell factory-made ones that aren’t worth your time or dime – and go easy on the rainbow-style
          food colourings.</p>

    <h1><strong>RESTAURANTS</strong></h1>
    <p>An insider's guide to the best places to eat in Paris, including Michelin-starred restaurants, traditional cafés and cheap French cuisine.Although the grand French gastronomic meal has just been beatified by Unesco, that gives little indication of
      the sheer variety of places to eat you can find here in Paris, from haute-cuisine temples to all-day cafés, eccentric wine bars, vintage bistros and the new “bistronomiques” serving affordable modern cuisine in a casual setting.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4><i>Benoit</i></h4>
        <img src="./img/localdishes/localdishes_8.jpg" style="width:400px;height:300px" alt="Benoit">
        <p>Just a few steps away from the Hôtel de Ville, discover the unique universe and authentic fare of this legendary bistro… A favorite address of all lovers of great French food who appreciate its family spirit and warm and friendly atmosphere; the
          restaurant Benoit which opened in 1912, remains one of the last authentic Parisians bistros. Enjoy the most typical and traditional foods, served on large porcelain plates in this memorable setting, decorated with large mirrors , etched glass
          panels, columns, tiles and woodwork. A delicious break in a timeless setting! </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4><i>L’Abeille</i></h4>
        <img src="./img/localdishes/localdishes_9.jpg" style="width:400px;height:300px" alt="L'Abeille">
        <p>Chef Christophe Moret, fresh from Alain Ducasse's Plaza Athénée and the overly formal Lasserre, now seems to have found his own more relaxed, gastronomic style. The haute-cuisine restaurant of the Shangri-La hotel, named after the Napoleonic bee
          motif was awarded two Michelin stars in 2016. Dress up to match the elegant setting, overlooking the gardens. Moret's modernised haute-cuisine mixes grand ingredients and plenty of vegetables, as in john dory with beetroot juice, or rabbit with
          swiss chard and truffles, and it's possible to have tasting menus with several half-size dishes. Moret also oversees the less-expensive, all-day Bauhinia restaurant, mixing French and Asian cuisine, and even concocting the 100% Green, all vegetable
          dinner one Thursday a month. The Cantonese Shang Palace restaurant, under chef Sam Lee Sum is the only Chinese restaurant in Paris to have a Michelin star.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4><i>Pierre Gagnaire Restaurant</i></h4>
        <img src="./img/localdishes/localdishes_10.jpg" style="width:400px;height:300px" alt="Gagnaire Restaurant">
        <p> A discovery trail of French cuisine from one of the most inventive chefs around today, who often finds inspiration in painting and jazz. The pared-back dining room provides the stage for a panoply of dishes, from minuscule appetisers – a tuna
          meringue, a clam with diced veg – to a whirlwind of desserts, all propelled by a fleet of lithe waiters. Although Pierre Gagnaire is often associated with molecular cuisine in his collaborations with scientist Hervé, this is real food, not froths
          and foams, with perfect seasoning and an extraordinary variety of flavours and textures. The lunch menu is a relatively affordable way to sample this extraordinary cuisine.</p>
