          <h1><strong>PARIS</strong></h1>
          <p title="Short Introduction">Paris is the capital and most populous city in France, with an administrative-limits area of 105 square kilometres (41 square miles) and an official population of 2,206,488 (2015). The city is a commune and department, and the heart of the 12,012-square-kilometre
            (4,638-square-mile) Île-de-France region (colloquially known as the 'Paris Region'), whose 2016 population of 12,142,802 represented roughly 18 percent of the population of France.Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of Europe's major
            centres of finance, commerce, fashion, science, and the arts.</p>

        <div id="Etymology">
          <h3><strong>ETYMOLOGY</strong></h3>
          <p>The name "Paris" is derived from its early inhabitants, the Celtic Parisii tribe. The city's name is not related to the Paris of Greek mythology. Paris is often referred to as <ins>The City of Light </ins> (La Ville Lumière),both because of
            its leading role during the Age of Enlightenment, and more literally because Paris was one of the first European cities to adopt gas street lighting. In the 1860s, the boulevards and streets of Paris were illuminated by 56,000 gas lamps.Since
            the late 19th century, Paris has also been known as Panam(e) (pronounced [panam]) in French slang.Inhabitants are known in English as "Parisians" and in French as Parisiens . They are also pejoratively called Parigots</p>

          <h3><strong>TOURISM</strong></h3>
          <p>Tourism in Paris continued to suffer in 2016, after two terrorist attacks in Paris in 2015 and an attack in Nice in 2016. The number of foreign visitors in Grand Paris (Paris plus the three surrounding departments) dropped by 11.5 percent in
            2016.The largest drops were in tourists from Japan (46.9 percent), Russia (35.5 percent), Italy (31.9 percent), and China (17.9 percent).The drops were particularly noticeable in the city's museums, especially the Louvre, where 70 percent
            of the visitors are from abroad. Attendance at the Louvre dropped by 15 percent in 2016: 61 percent fewer Japanese visitors, 47 percent fewer Brazilian visitors, and 31 percent fewer Chinese visitors. Visitors from the United States were down
            by 5.7 percent. Similar drops were reported at the Musee d'Orsay (visitors down by 13 percent from 2015) and the Palace of Versailles (down by 15 percent).</p>
          <img class="img-fluid" title="Arc de Triomphe" src="./img/home/home_2.jpg" alt="Arc de Triumph">
          <h4><strong>Monuments</strong></h4> The city's top tourist attraction was the <ins>Notre Dame Cathedral</ins> , which welcomed 12 million visitors in 2016. The Louvre museum had 7.3 million visitors in 2016, making it the most visited art museum in the world.After the Louvre,
          the other top museums in Paris in 2016 were the Centre Pompidou (3.3 million visitors), Musée d'Orsay (3 million visitors), and the National Museum of Natural History (1.5 million visitors). Other top sites in 2016 were the Basilique du Sacré-Cœur
          (10 million visitors), the Eiffel Tower (5.9 million visitors), and the Arc de Triomphe (1.3 million visitors).The centre of Paris contains the most visited monuments in the city, including the Notre Dame Cathedral and the Louvre as well as
          the Sainte-Chapelle; Les Invalides, where the tomb of Napoleon is located, and the Eiffel Tower are located on the Left Bank south-west of the centre. The banks of the Seine from the Pont de Sully to the Pont d'Iéna have been listed as a UNESCO
          World Heritage Site since 1991.Other landmarks are laid out east to west along the historical axis of Paris, which runs from the Louvre through the Tuileries Garden, the Luxor Column in the Place de la Concorde, and the Arc de Triomphe, to the
          Grande Arche of La Défense.
