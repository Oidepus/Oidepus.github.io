          <h1><strong>HISTORICAL PLACES </strong></h1>
          <p> Paris is a city with a dizzying history that stretches back to the 3rd century <abbr title="Before Christ">BC</abbr>. No surprise, then, that important Paris monuments are so numerous, breathtaking, and varied in terms of period and architectural
            style. From Roman-era ruins to post-World War II memorials, these famous sites and monuments in the city of light are essential keys to understanding the city's rich and complicated past. </p>
          <ul>

              <h4>Notre-Dame Cathedral</h4>
              <img class="img-fluid" title="Notre-Dame Cathedral" src="./img/historicalplaces/historicalplaces_1.jpg" style="width:400px;height:300px;" alt="Notre Dame">
              <p>Dating to the 12th century, Notre Dame dramatically towers alongside the banks of the Seine river, beckoning all to come revel in it. It's simply breathtaking, with its intricate Gothic architectural details-- ones that reportedly took workers
                over a century to complete-- its flying buttresses; its famed bell tower from which one can still imagine Hugo's Quasimodo carrying out his duties; the scary or humorous gargoyles and grotesques; the stunning rose window inside. It's a
                sight that isn't likely to leave you indifferent. If you have extra time, make sure to pay a visit to the archaeological crypt at Notre Dame, to learn more about the history of its construction, and other fascinating elements. </p>

              <h4><i>Eiffel Tower</i></h4>
              <img class="img-fluid" title="Eiffel Tower" src="./img/historicalplaces/historicalplaces_2.jpg" alt="Eiffel">
              <p>When the world's most famous landmark was presented as part of the 1889 World Exposition in Paris, most decried it as an eyesore on the city's horizon, and many others demanded its removal. Who would have thought, then, that the Eiffel Tower
                would become such an enduring and beloved icon of the city of light--literally and figuratively? Hint: try to avoid visiting at peak hours and on weekends, so you can make the most of your visit and really enjoy the views from the top.

              <h4> <i>Père Lachaise Cemetery</i> </h4>
              <img class="img-fluid" title="Père Lachaise Cemetery" src="./img/historicalplaces/historicalplaces_3.jpg" style="width:500px ;height:300px;" alt="Pere Lachaise">
              <p>There are many beautiful cemeteries within Paris' city walls, but it is the opinion of this writer that Père Lachaise is the loveliest among these. In addition to hosting the graves of famous souls from Oscar Wilde to playwright Molière
                and Jim Morrison, the cemetery is simply a gorgeous place to stroll and meditate. There are also important war memorials on the site, paying tribute to the many who perished in conflicts and wars. Especially on a nice day, going up the
                gentle slopes of the cemetery to look down at this city of the dead can be...remarkably pleasant.</p>

              <h4> <i>The Louvre Palace and Museum</i> </h4>
              <img class="img-fluid" title="The Louvre Palace and Museum" src="./img/historicalplaces/historicalplaces_4.jpg" style="width:500px ;height:300px;" alt="The Louvre">
              <p>Most think of the monumental Louvre as a museum, but it was a fortress and palace long before it became a world center for art. The palace is testament to a rich history spanning from the medieval period to the present. Visiting the Louvre's
                medeival foundations is fascinating. The adjacent Tuileries gardens are perfect for a stroll pre-or post-visit.</p>

              <h4> <i>Arc de Triomphe</i> </h4>
              <img class="img-fluid" title="Arc de Triomphe" src="./img/historicalplaces/historicalplaces_5.jpg" style="width:500px ;height:400px;" alt="Arc de Triomphe">
              <p>Looming 164 feet above the bustling traffic circle at the head of the Avenue des Champs-Elysées, the Arc de Triomphe seems to exemplify pomp and circumstance. You just don't get structures like these anymore: an icon of imperial France under
                Napoléon I, the arch is testament to a time when European leaders felt no shame in erecting massive structures in the service of their equally massive egos. Many don't bother to take the tour to the top, but the views over the elegant
                avenue, stretching all the way to the Place de la Concorde, through the Tuileries and on to the Louvre, is more than worthwhile</p>
